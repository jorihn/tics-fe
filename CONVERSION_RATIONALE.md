# Conversion rationale (mapped to funnel metrics)

## 1) Improve L3/L1 (open miniapp after /start)

- Home hero communicates outcome in plain language within 5-10s.
- Primary CTA is high-contrast and repeated as sticky mobile CTA.
- Trust strip reduces perceived risk early (privacy, fast setup, cancel anytime).

Why this helps: users arriving from Telegram `/start` quickly understand benefit and have one clear action to continue.

## 2) Improve L6/L3 (reach plan selection from home)

- CTA wording is explicit: "View Assistant Plans".
- Hero and sticky CTA both route to `/agents`.
- Minimal distractions: one primary action and one low-priority secondary demo placeholder.

Why this helps: lowers navigation ambiguity and increases click-through from Home to plans.

## 3) Improve L8/L6 (payment completion from plans)

- Plan cards are concise: who it is for, outcome, price, choose action.
- Checkout stays on same page to avoid context loss.
- Payment methods are simple tabs (VND vs USDT).
- Explicit payment states: pending / success / failed, with retry path.
- Tracking events instrument each key decision and failure point.

Why this helps: fewer steps and clearer status feedback reduce drop-off during payment.
